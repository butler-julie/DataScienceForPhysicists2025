# Using Data Science to Understand Complexity in Soft Matter Systems

We will spend most of our time working through a specific example, which uses ML to identify structural features which are predictive of dynamics in a supercooled liquid. Remarkably, this leads to a nice physical picture, so in the end we feel we've learned something about the physics of the system!

Specifically, we will be trying to reproduce some results from https://doi.org/10.1038/nphys3644, by working through the notebook ``Softness.ipynb``.
